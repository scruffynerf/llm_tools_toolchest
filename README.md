# llm_tools_toolchest
A collection of python tools for use with LLMs

This will be a collection of tool functions for use with LLMs like OpenAI, Ollama, Mistral, Anthropic, etc etc

Still to be organized but likely will have folders of related code.  Each tool will be self contained, hopefully.

I'll document the format, and standard to be met.

This will work well with the Agenostic 'import/export' methods I'm working on.
but will be more generally useful.

For Agent frameworks that need more of a wrapper around the code, I'll document that wrapper, and maybe add a script for it
